.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmproxy
acts as a protocol proxy,
allowing Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to
one or more
.BR pmcd (1)
and/or
.BR redis-server (1)
instances via
.BR pmproxy .
.PP
In its default mode of operation, on platforms supporting this,
.B pmproxy
provides the REST API for all PCP services (see
.BR PMWEBAPI (3)
for details)
and interfaces to the fast, scalable time series query
capabilities offered by PCP in conjunction with a
.BR redis-server (1)
(see
.BR pmseries (1)
for details).
.PP
.B pmproxy
can be deployed in a firewall domain, or on a cluster ``head'' node
where the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the hosts where
.B pmcd
and/or
.B redis-server
are running may be unknown to the PCP monitoring clients, but where
the IP address of the host running
.B pmproxy
is known to these clients.
Similarly, the clients may have network connectivity only to the
host where
.B pmproxy
is running, while there is network connectivity from that host to the
hosts of interest where
.B pmcd
and/or
.B redis-server
are running.
.PP
The behaviour of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by either the
.B PMPROXY_HOST
environment variable or through the extended hostname specification
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients will make their
.BR PMAPI (3)
connections directly to
.BR pmcd .
If the proxy hostname syntax is used or
.B PMPROXY_HOST
is set, then this should be the hostname or IP address of the system
where
.B pmproxy
is running, and the clients will connect to
.B pmcd
or
.B redis-server
indirectly through the protocol proxy services of
.BR pmproxy.
.SH OPTIONS
The options to
.B pmproxy
are as follows:
.TP
.B \-A
Disable service advertisement.
By default,
.B pmproxy
will advertise its presence on the network using any available mechanisms
(such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote monitoring tools with finding it.
These mechanisms are disabled with this option.
.TP
\f3\-c\f1 \f2file\f1, \f3\-\-config\f1=\f2file\f1
Specify the path to an optional configuration
.IR file ,
with format as described in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3timeseries\f1 mode.
.TP
\f3\-C\f1 \f2dirname\f1, \f3\-\-certpath\f1=\f2dirname\f1
Specify the path to the Network Security Services certificate database,
for (optional) secure connections.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3deprecated\f1 mode.
The default is
.BR /etc/pki/nssdb .
Refer also to the \f3\-P\f1 option.
If it does not already exist, this database can be created using the
.B certutil
utility.
This process and other certificate database maintenance information
is provided in the
.BR PCPIntro (1)
manual page and the online PCP tutorials.
.TP
\f3\-d\f1, \f3\-\-deprecated\f1
By default
.B pmproxy
prefers to run in the new \f3timeseries\f1 mode, providing REST APIs,
asynchronous network I/O, scalable time series, and secure connections
using OpenSSL.
However, legacy deployments may wish to use the original synchronous
.B pmproxy
implementation using NSS and libpcp networking; this can be achieved
using this option.
Note that the \f3\-d\f1 and \f3\-t\f1 options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
\f3\-f\f1, \f3\-\-foreground\f1
By default
.B pmproxy
is started as a daemon.
The
.B \-f
option indicates that it should run in the foreground.
This is most useful when trying to diagnose problems with establishing
connections.
.TP
\f3\-h\f1 \f2host\f1, \f3\-\-redishost\f1=\f2host\f1
Specify an alternate Redis
.I host
to connect to for time series querying, overriding any configuration
file settings.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3timeseries\f1 mode.
.TP
\f3\-i\f1 \f2ipaddress\f1
This option is usually only used on hosts with more than one network
interface (very common for firewall and ``head'' node hosts where
.B pmproxy
is likely to be deployed to arbitrate access to an internal network).
If no
.B \-i
options are specified
.B pmproxy
accepts PCP client connections on any of its host's IP addresses.
The
.B \-i
option is used to specify explicitly an IP address that PCP client connections should be
accepted on.
.I ipaddress
should be in the standard dotted form (e.g. 100.23.45.6).
The
.B \-i
option may be used multiple times to define a list of IP addresses.
When one or more
.B \-i
options is specified, attempted connections made on any other IP addresses will be refused.
.TP
\f3\-l\f1 \f2file\f1, \f3\-\-log\f1=\f2file\f1
By default a log file named
.I pmproxy.log
is written in the current directory.
The
.B \-l
option causes the log file to be written to a given
.I file
instead of the default.
If this
.I file
cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.
.TP
\f3\-L\f1 \f2bytes\f1
.IR PDU s 
received by 
.B pmproxy 
from PCP monitoring clients are restricted to a
maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to defend against Denial of
Service attacks.
The 
.B \-L 
option may be used to change the maximum incoming 
.I PDU 
size.
.TP
\f3\-M\f1 \f2name\f1, \f3\-\-certname\f1=\f2name\f1
By default
.B pmproxy
will try to use a certificate called
.B "PCP Collector certificate"
in its server role.
The
.B \-M
option allows this certficate
.I name
to be changed.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3deprecated\f1 mode.
.TP
\f3\-p\f1 \f2port\f1, \f3\-\-redisport\f1=\f2port\f1
Specify an alternate Redis
.I port
number to connect to for time series querying, overriding any
configuration file settings.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3timeseries\f1 mode.
.TP
\f3\-P\f1 \f2file\f1, \f3\-\-passfile\f1=\f2file\f1
Specify the path to a
.I file
containing the Network Security Services certificate
database password for (optional) secure connections, and for databases that are
password protected.
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3deprecated\f1 mode.
Refer also to the \f3\-C\f1 option.
When using this option, great care should be exercised to ensure appropriate
ownership ("pcp" user, typically) and permissions on this file (0400, so as to
be unreadable by any user other than the user running the
.B pmproxy
process).
.TP
\f3\-s\f1 \f2sockname\f1, \f3\-\-socket\f1=\f2sockname\f1
Specify the path to a local unix domain socket (for platforms supporting this
socket family only).
The default value is
.IR $PCP_RUN_DIR/pmproxy.socket .
This option implies \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3timeseries\f1 mode.
.TP
\fB\-t\f1, \fB\-\-timeseries\f1
Operate in automatic archive timeseries discovery mode.
This mode of operation will enable the
.BR PMWEBAPI (3)
REST APIs, detect system archives created by
.BR pmlogger (1)
and import them into a
.BR redis-server (1)
automatically, for fast, scalable time series querying described in
.BR pmseries (1).
.TP
\f3\-U\f1 \f2user\f1, \f3\-\-username\f1=\f2user\f1
Assume the identity of the given
.I user
before starting to accept incoming packets from PCP monitoring clients.
.TP
\f3\-x\f1 \f2file\f1
Before the
.B pmproxy
.I logfile
can be opened, 
.B pmproxy
may encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting.
By default the output describing this error is sent to
.B /dev/tty
but it may redirected to 
.IR file .
.SH CONFIGURATION
When running in the \f3timeseries\f1 mode of operation, runtime
configuration is relatively complex and typically handled via the
.I $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmproxy/pmproxy.conf
file.
This file is in the common ``ini'' format, with section headers
and individual variables and values with each section.
The configuration file installed as part of PCP documents
every available section and option.
.PP
At a high level, the
.I [pmproxy]
section can be used to explicitly enable or disable each of the
different protocols.
.PP
The
.I [pmseries]
section allows connection information for one or more backing
.B redis-server
processes to be configured (hostnames and ports).
Note to access multiple (scalable) Redis servers, the
.I servers
variable in this section can be a comma-separated list of
hostname:port pairs.
Alternatively, it can be a single
.B redis-server
host that will be queried using the "CLUSTER INFO" command to
automatically configure multiple backing hosts, described at
.UR https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec
.UE .
.SH STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY
Normally,
.B pmproxy
is started automatically at boot time and stopped when the
system is being brought down.
Under certain circumstances it is necessary to start or stop
.B pmproxy
manually.
To do this one must become superuser and type
.PP
.ft CS
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start
.ft
.PP
to start
.BR pmproxy ,
or
.PP
.ft CS
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop
.ft
.PP
to stop
.BR pmproxy .
Starting
.B pmproxy
when it is already running is the same as stopping
it and then starting it again.
.P
Normally
.B pmproxy
listens for PCP client connections on TCP/IP port number 44322
(as well as 44323 with \f3timeseries\f1 enabled) registered at
.UR https://www.iana.org/
.UE .
Either the environment
variable
.B PMPROXY_PORT
.B \-p
command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
.B PMPROXY_PORT
or the
.B \-p
command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
.B pmproxy
is started; in each case, the specification is a comma-separated list
of one or more numerical port numbers.
Should both methods be used or multiple
.B \-p
options appear on the command line,
.B pmproxy
will listen on the union of the set of ports specified via all
.B \-p
options and the
.B PMPROXY_PORT
environment variable.
If non-default ports are used with
.B pmproxy
care should be taken to ensure that
.B PMPROXY_PORT
is also set in the environment of any client application that
will connect to
.BR pmproxy ,
or that the extended host specification syntax is used
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If
.B pmproxy
is already running the message "Error: OpenRequestSocket bind: Address already
in use" will appear.
This may also appear if
.B pmproxy
was shutdown with an outstanding request from a client.
In this case, a
request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state and until the system closes
it down (after some timeout period) it will not be possible to run
.BR pmproxy .
.PP
In addition to the standard
.B PCP
debugging options, see
.BR pmdbg (1),
.B pmproxy
currently supports the debugging option
.B context
for tracing client connections and disconnections.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP
.B PCP_PMPROXYOPTIONS_PATH
command line options for
.B pmproxy
when launched from
.B $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy
All the command line option lines should start with a hyphen as
the first character.
.TP
.B $PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmproxy
additional environment variables that will be set when
.B pmproxy
executes.
Only settings of the form "PMPROXY_VARIABLE=value" will be honoured.
.TP

(or
.B $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmproxy/pmproxy.log
when started automatically)
.br
All messages and diagnostics are directed here
.TP
.B /etc/pki/tls
default OpenSSL certificate database directory, used for optional
Secure Socket Layer connections in \f3timeseries\f1 mode of operation.
These certificates can be created and queried using the
.B openssl
tool, amongst others.
.TP
.B /etc/pki/nssdb
default Network Sercity Services (NSS) database directory, used for optional
Secure Socket Layer connections in \f3deprecated\f1 mode of operation.
This database can be created and queried using the NSS
.B certutil
tool, amongst others.
This is only used when \f3pmproxy\f1 is running in \f3deprecated\f1 mode.
.PD
.SH ENVIRONMENT
In addition to the PCP environment variables described in the
.B "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
section below, there are several environment variables that
influence the interactions between a PCP monitoring client,
.B pmproxy
and
.BR pmcd .
.TP
.B PMCD_PORT
For the PCP monitoring client this (or the default port number) is passed to
.B pmproxy
and used to connect to
.BR pmcd .
In the environment of
.B pmproxy
.B PMCD_PORT is not used.
.TP
.B PMPROXY_HOST
For the PCP monitoring client this is the hostname or IP address of the
host where
.B pmproxy
is running.
In recent versions of PCP (since version 3) this has been superseded by
the extended hostname syntax
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details).
.TP
.B PMPROXY_PORT
For the PCP monitoring client this is the port on which
.B pmproxy
will accept connections.
The default is 44322, as well as 44323 with \f3timeseries\f1 enabled.
.TP
.BR PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT ", " PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT " and " PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
(see
.BR PCPIntro (1))
For the PCP monitoring client, setting these environment variables
will modify the timeouts used for interactions between the client
and
.BR pmproxy
(independent of which
.B pmcd
is being used).
For
.B pmproxy
these same environment variables control the timeouts between
.B pmproxy
and all
.BR pmcd (1)
instances (independent of which monitoring client is involved).
.PP
If set to the value 1, the
.B PMPROXY_LOCAL
environment variable will cause
.B pmproxy
to run in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds only
to the loopback interface.
.PP
The
.B PMPROXY_MAXPENDING
variable can be set to indicate the maximum length to which the queue
of pending client connections may grow.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
